# CS2400
I retook this class with 2 different instructors so the content is a little scattered. I lost the original files so I am doing my best to recreate them based off of notes and the assignment description if available.

##Simulators
Keil uVision and ARMSim from University of Victoria 

I can't recommend ARMSim enough, you can find it here:

uVision is a great professional tool, but ARMSim is simple enough to help students understand what they are doing without overwhelming thgem with menus and options
